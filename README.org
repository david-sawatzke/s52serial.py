* A Serial Programmer for the AT89S52
Licensed under GPLv3

Uses Python 3
** Needed Hardware
- [[https://github.com/bvernoux/hydrabus][Hydrabus]] (Similar to BusPirate, probably very simple to adapt)
** Dependencies
- Python 3
- PySerial
** Wiring
- Connect Vcc to 5V and GND to GND (duh)
- Connect SPI, MOSI and MISO between the chip and the Hydrabus
- The AT89S52 needs a clock, so connect an oscillator to XTAL1 and XTAL2
- The reset pin needs 0.7 * Vcc, so connect it to a pullup to 5V and a diode to
  CS, so when the CS Pin is 0V, the Reset Pin is under 1V. This may not work all
  the time, use a transistor or something similar in that case
** Gotchas
- The hex parser is very basic, only usable for certain types of hex files, for
  example the ones output by as31
- No checking for the device
- Some delays needed by hardware only provided by slowness of python
- When something fails, the hydrabus may not be properly reset
** To be done
- Implement proper hex parsing
  - Maybe use a library
- Solve the problem of flash write waiting a bit nicer
  - Currently, the programm only transfers one byte at a time
- Check chip IDs
